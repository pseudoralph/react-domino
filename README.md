# Double-9 Domino

#### Epicodus capstone project created in React

#### Ralph Perdomo. March 1, 2019

## Description

Note on spelling: Dominó is spelled with an accent mark over the o (indicating the o is a stressed syllable) in Spanish. Both dominó and domino (without the accent mark) may appear interchangibly within this project.

Most online domino games are based on a double-6 set. Cuban dominos, however, are played using a double-9 set Great Book of Domino Games.

This project is that domino game.

## Technologies Used

JS, React 16.8

## Branch todo

- [ ] refactor game logic— use "first move" and only record where ficha is dropped and not where it CAN be played (don't eval left and right move)

- [ ] add navigator.userAgent to player stats and game start time/date

- [ ] add hammer JS

- [ ] add end game event— game win from emptying hand

- [ ] count out how many skips— two skips in a row (board stays the same size)

- [ ] only allow skip when player doesn't have ficha to play— no cheat skipping

- [ ] randomize who goes first on first game
